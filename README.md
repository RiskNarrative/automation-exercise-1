# Goal

Imagine you are required to test the following [PROJECT](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/web/web-form.html) and you need to output test results for stakeholders.

For this you need to provide a test framework in Selenium/Java, that tests:
- Any UI parts in the Project above
- **Optional** - You can add test API calls (no APIs are provided in this project, plenty of public APIs are available here - https://www.freepublicapis.com/)

All the aspects above should be scenarios written in Cucumber describing the expected behaviour

# The Framework should:
- Run on any OS
- Have clear instructions how we can run the tests and check the output (report)
- Code should be in a GitHub repository

# Important Notes:
- Please resolve as much as you can in an efficient way, it is not mandatory to solve all, it only helps us
in the technical evaluation as a basis for discussion.
- Please spend no longer than 2 days working on this task. (we appreciate that this isn’t much time but we’d like to
see how much you can accomplish in the given time)
- Any work which cannot be done in this time please document it to show what you would have done if
you had more time.
